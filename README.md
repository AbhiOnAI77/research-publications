## Industry Relevance & Business Impact 
My work focuses on translating complex data (including unstructured text, satellite imagery, and large observational datasets) into actionable insights that support strategic and operational decision-making. By combining rigorous causal inference, machine learning, and scalable data pipelines, I build analytical systems that help organizations anticipate demand shifts, assess risk, evaluate strategic positioning, and improve forecasting in environments characterized by high uncertainty and incomplete information. This approach enables rapid engagement with real-world industry challenges, emphasizing robustness, interpretability, and business relevance over purely predictive performance.
